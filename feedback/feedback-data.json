This isn't the instructors fault or anyone's fault really - its simply that I went into this program with super high expectations (because it was expensive so i thought it would be extremely helpfull to my career) and this program hasn't yet fullifiled them. There still are 5ish days left in the program, so maybe I just need to give the program more of a chance",
